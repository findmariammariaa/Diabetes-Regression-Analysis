# Diabetes Progression Prediction using Regression Analysis

This project is the final step of my training program on Python and data science. It applies regression analysis on the **Diabetes dataset** to predict disease progression in patients, demonstrating end-to-end data science workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict diabetes progression using regression techniques in Python. The project involves:

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing data structure, feature correlations, and distributions.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Scaling and preparing data for modeling.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Using regression models, with performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
4. **Cross-Validation**: Implementing k-fold cross-validation to ensure model reliability.
5. **Visualization**: Visual comparisons between actual and predicted values.

## Requirements

To run the code, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

Install these libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Notebook

All code for the project is contained in a Google Colab notebook. [Download the notebook](link-to-notebook) and open it in Google Colab to view and execute the code directly.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/findmariammariaa/Diabetes-Progression-Prediction.git
    cd Diabetes-Progression-Prediction
    ```

2. **Open the Colab Notebook**:

   Upload the notebook to your Google Drive and open it in Google Colab to run the code and explore the project in detail.

## Project Outcomes

This project reinforces skills in data manipulation, regression modeling, and evaluation techniques in Python. The hands-on approach with real-world data provides insights into predicting disease progression based on medical data.

## Future Work

- Experiment with additional regression models, such as Ridge and RandomForest.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for enhanced performance.
- Explore advanced visualizations to deepen insights.
